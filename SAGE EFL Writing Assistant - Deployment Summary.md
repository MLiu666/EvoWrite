### Frontend (React)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state
- **Features**: Login, Chat Interface, Writing Workspace, Analytics Dashboard

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Agent SAGE Framework
- **User Agent**: Handles user input processing and intent classification
- **Assistant Agent**: Provides educational content and writing feedback using LLM
- **Checker Agent**: Validates responses and ensures quality

### 2. Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) Support
- Cognitive strategies for writing improvement
- Metacognitive reflection prompts
- Social-behavioral learning recommendations
- Motivational support and encouragement

### 3. Personalized Learning Experience
- Learner profiling based on proficiency level and course type
- Adaptive content generation based on individual needs
- Progress tracking and analytics

### 4. RECIPE4U Dataset Integration
