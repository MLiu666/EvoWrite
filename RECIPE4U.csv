When there is a dependency between the sentences, we need to use commas to make them clear.","Yes, that's correct! Commas are an important tool for clarity in scientific writing, especially when dealing with dependent clauses. Can you give me an example of how you might use commas to clarify dependencies in a sentence?",4,Answer,,False,"In one sense, the ambiguity of Intel syntax (due to the absence of an official Intel assembly syntax manual) is the problem. For decades, many assemblers have been developed ad-hoc without any standards. So, it seems to be a hard decision problem to allow/deny several tokens or to choose the right usage. On the other hand, Clang need to handle both two cases. They may reduce the usability and correctness of Clang. A user might want to write a function named ""or"", but get rejected by Clang. A user might want to load a data pointer named ""rsp"", but the resulting program loads a stack pointer, which can differ from the user's intention."

Can you give me an example of how you might use commas to clarify dependencies in a sentence?","Ok. One example sentence might be:
""Because I skipped my lunch today, I am very hungry now.","Great example! In this sentence, ""because I skipped my lunch today"" is a dependent clause that functions as an adverb to modify the independent clause, ""I am very hungry now."" So to show the dependency between these two clauses, you would use a comma: ""Because I skipped my lunch today, I am very hungry now."" By doing so, you clarify the relationship between the two ideas and make it easier for your reader to follow your reasoning.",5,Answer,,False,"In one sense, the ambiguity of Intel syntax (due to the absence of an official Intel assembly syntax manual) is the problem.

And I want to find points where I did not use commas correctly.","I have identified a few spots where commas would be helpful to clarify your sentence structure. 

First, you can add a comma after ""syntax"" to separate the two clauses in the following sentence: ""In one sense, the ambiguity of Intel syntax (due to the absence of an official Intel assembly syntax manual) is the problem."" This will make it clear that ""due to the absence of an official Intel assembly syntax manual"" is a dependent clause that modifies ""Intel syntax.""
