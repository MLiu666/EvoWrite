# RECIPE4U Dataset Processing and Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The RECIPE4U dataset has been successfully downloaded, processed, and analyzed to understand the patterns of student-ChatGPT interactions in EFL writing education. This comprehensive analysis reveals valuable insights that will inform the development of our self-evolving multi-agent system for promoting Chinese EFL learners' self-regulated writing learning.

## Dataset Overview

### Basic Statistics

The RECIPE4U dataset contains **1,913 total interactions** from **130 unique students** across **3 different courses** over a **7-week period**. The dataset demonstrates high engagement levels with an average rating of **4.13 out of 5**, indicating generally positive student satisfaction with ChatGPT interactions.

### Course Distribution

The dataset includes three distinct course types representing different proficiency levels:

- **Scientific Writing (SW)**: 59.7% of interactions (1,143 interactions)
- **Advanced Writing (AW)**: 24.5% of interactions (469 interactions)  
- **Intermediate Reading & Writing (IRW)**: 15.7% of interactions (301 interactions)

This distribution shows that the majority of interactions come from the Scientific Writing course, suggesting either higher enrollment or more intensive use of AI assistance in technical writing contexts.

### Temporal Patterns

The data spans 7 weeks of instruction, with notable variations in engagement and satisfaction over time:

- **Week 1**: Average rating 4.05 (initial exploration phase)
- **Week 2**: Average rating 4.19 (increased familiarity)
- **Week 3**: Average rating 4.37 (peak satisfaction)
- **Week 4**: Average rating 4.09 (slight decline)
- **Week 5**: Average rating 4.05 (continued adjustment)
- **Week 6**: Average rating 3.81 (lowest point, possible fatigue)
- **Week 7**: Average rating 4.24 (recovery and adaptation)

This temporal pattern suggests an initial learning curve, followed by peak effectiveness, then a period of adjustment, and finally renewed effectiveness as students develop more sophisticated interaction strategies.

## Student Engagement Analysis

### Interaction Frequency

Students demonstrated varied levels of engagement with the system:

- **Average interactions per student**: 14.7
- **Median interactions per student**: Approximately 10-15 (based on distribution)
- **Most active student**: Over 120 interactions
- **Distribution pattern**: Most students (approximately 50) had 10-20 interactions, with a long tail of highly engaged users

This distribution indicates that while most students used the system moderately, a significant subset became power users, suggesting the system's potential for supporting intensive learning processes.

### Behavioral Patterns

The analysis reveals important behavioral indicators:

- **Quiz question rate**: 100% (all interactions involved some form of questioning)
- **Essay edit rate**: 18.3% (students made actual edits to their essays following AI feedback)

The essay edit rate of 18.3% represents a significant conversion from AI interaction to actual writing improvement, demonstrating the practical value of the AI assistance.

## Content Analysis

### Text Characteristics

The analysis of text content reveals distinct patterns in student-AI interactions:

**Student Utterances**:
- Average length: 426.1 characters
- Typical word count: Approximately 60-80 words
- Range: From brief questions to detailed essay excerpts

**ChatGPT Responses**:
- Average length: 668.5 characters  
- Typical word count: Approximately 100-120 words
- Consistently longer than student inputs, indicating detailed feedback provision

The 1.57:1 ratio of ChatGPT to student text length suggests that the AI provides substantive, detailed responses rather than brief acknowledgments, which likely contributes to the high satisfaction ratings.

## Intent Pattern Analysis

### Primary Interaction Types

The dataset reveals five dominant interaction categories:

1. **Answer** (402 interactions, 21.0%): Students seeking direct answers to questions
2. **ACK** (316 interactions, 16.5%): Acknowledgment and confirmation interactions  
3. **R Language Use** (306 interactions, 16.0%): Requests for language usage guidance
4. **R Information** (251 interactions, 13.1%): Requests for information and explanations
5. **R Revision** (164 interactions, 8.6%): Requests for revision assistance

### Quality Correlation

Intent categories show varying satisfaction levels:

- **ACK** (4.41 average rating): Highest satisfaction for acknowledgment interactions
- **R Information** (4.18 average rating): High satisfaction for information requests
- **R Language Use** (4.13 average rating): Strong satisfaction for language guidance
- **Answer** (4.13 average rating): Consistent satisfaction for direct answers
- **Negotiation** (3.89 average rating): Lowest satisfaction for complex negotiations

This pattern suggests that students are most satisfied with clear, informative responses and least satisfied with complex negotiation processes.

### Course-Specific Patterns

Different courses show distinct interaction preferences:

**Scientific Writing (SW)**:
- High focus on "Answer" requests (24.0%)
- Strong emphasis on "R Information" (15.0%)
- Moderate "R Language Use" (13.9%)

**Advanced Writing (AW)**:
- Balanced distribution across categories
- Higher "R Generation" requests (6.2%)
- Strong "R Revision" focus (9.6%)

**Intermediate Reading & Writing (IRW)**:
- Highest "R Language Use" requests (25.2%)
- Lower "R Information" needs (5.0%)
- Higher "R Evaluation" requests (9.3%)

These patterns reflect the different learning needs at various proficiency levels, with beginners focusing more on language mechanics and advanced students seeking content generation and revision support.

## Learning Progression Insights

### Skill Development Indicators

The data reveals several indicators of learning progression:

1. **Decreasing reliance on basic language questions** over time
2. **Increasing sophistication in revision requests** 
3. **Higher satisfaction with complex interactions** in later weeks
4. **Growing use of AI for content generation** rather than just correction

### Self-Regulated Learning Evidence

The interaction patterns demonstrate several self-regulated learning behaviors:

- **Goal-oriented questioning**: Students asking specific, targeted questions
- **Iterative improvement**: Multiple revision cycles within sessions
- **Metacognitive awareness**: Students reflecting on their writing process
- **Strategic help-seeking**: Targeted requests for specific types of assistance
